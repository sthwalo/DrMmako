## Design and Implementation Stages

### 1. Project Setup and Configuration
- Initialized project using Vite with React and TypeScript
- Configured TailwindCSS for styling
- Set up ESLint and TypeScript configurations
- Implemented routing using React Router DOM

### 2. Component Architecture
The project follows a component-based architecture with:
- **Pages**: Main route components (Home, About, Services, Contact)
- **Components**: Reusable UI components for consistent design
- **Layout**: Common layout elements shared across pages

### 3. Styling Implementation
- Utilizes TailwindCSS for responsive and utility-first styling
- Custom CSS for specific components when needed
- Consistent design system throughout the application

### 4. Routing and Navigation
- Implemented client-side routing using React Router
- Created navigation structure for main pages
- Handled route transitions and page loading states

### 5. Performance Optimization
- Code splitting for better load times
- Optimized asset loading
- TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
